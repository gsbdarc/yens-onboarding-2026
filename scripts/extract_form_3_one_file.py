"""Stage 3 of 3 — validates the model's answer against a schema.

This is the finished script. Day 2 profiles it and runs it under Slurm.

New since stage 2:
    Form3Filing            a Pydantic model declaring the fields you expect, and their types
    the schema in the prompt   so the model calls each field what your code calls it
    response_format        constrains the reply to valid JSON while the model writes it
    model_validate_json    checks the finished reply and raises if it doesn't match

Two other deliberate changes: it asks for more fields than stage 2 (the company and
the filing date), and it switches to a stronger model now that the prompt is settled.

To see exactly what changed:
    diff scripts/extract_form_3_step2_logged.py scripts/extract_form_3_one_file.py

Run it from the repo root:
    python3 scripts/extract_form_3_one_file.py
