## The limit

Every scheduler puts a ceiling on arrays, and on the Yens' `normal` partition it is
**`MaxArraySize` = 512**. Read it off the cluster rather than taking our word for it:

```bash
scontrol show config | grep MaxArraySize
```

What that number caps is the **task index**, not the number of tasks. Slurm allows an index
of 0, so the highest index you may use is one less than `MaxArraySize` — **511**. An array
therefore holds at most 512 tasks, numbered `0` to `511`, and `--array=0-511` is the largest
one you can submit.

Try to go past it and the submission is simply refused:

```bash
sbatch --reservation=class --array=0-991 slurm/extract_array.slurm
```

The important part is that this cap applies to **every submission**, independently. There is
no second window of higher indices waiting for a second `sbatch` — index 512 is out of
bounds in a fresh array exactly as it was in the first one.

### The other limits worth knowing

`MaxArraySize` is the one that stops you today, but it is not the only ceiling on an array:

| | What it limits | Where to see it |
|---|---|---|
| **`MaxArraySize`** | The highest task **index** — so also the largest array | `scontrol show config \| grep MaxArraySize` |
| **`%` throttle** | How many tasks run **at once**, without changing how many exist — `--array=0-511%20` keeps 20 running | your own directive |
| **QoS caps** | How much of a partition **one user** may hold — running jobs, submitted jobs, total cores | `sacctmgr show qos normal` |
| **`--time`** | Per **task**, not per array. A hundred tasks each get the full allowance | your own directive |

The `%` throttle is the one people wish they had known about sooner: it is how you run a
large array without taking the whole partition, and it costs you nothing but wall-clock.

## Your problem

`data/aws_links.csv` lists **992** filings. You have run 100 of them. The ceiling is 512
tasks per submission.

Work out how to process all 992. You have everything you need — page 2's array, page 3's
rerun-safety, and the limit above. Hints are at the bottom if you want them; use Claude to
think it through or work it out on paper, but be able to explain the route you chose.

{: .warning }
> **992 API calls is real money, and the whole room is submitting at once.** Work the cost
> out from your 100-filing numbers *before* you submit, and **check the number with an
> instructor**. This is the one job today where getting the arithmetic wrong is expensive
> rather than merely slow.

## Size it

Whatever route you pick, the per-task numbers may change — if a task now handles more than
one filing, one `--time` has to cover all of them. You are not guessing this time:
[2. Scale the Loop to an Array]({{ '/day2/loop-to-array/' | relative_url }}) left you real
`sacct` numbers for a single filing to build on.

## Run it

```bash
mkdir -p logs
watch squeue --me
```

When it drains, count what landed:

```bash
ls results/*.json | wc -l
```

Short of 992? That is what rerun-safety is for — resubmit. Finished tasks find their output
and exit immediately, so only the gaps are redone.

## Document it, and push

In `README.md`, next to your 100-filing numbers, record what the full run actually took:
per-task time and memory from `sacct`, total wall-clock, how many tasks you split it into,
and which route you chose and why.

```bash
sacct -j JOBID --format=JobID,State,Elapsed,MaxRSS
```

Then commit it. Ask Claude Code to handle it:

```
> Add and commit my array scripts and README changes with a message like "Day 2: all 992 filings through an array", then push to my fork.
```

## Before you go

You started yesterday with a script that ran one filing on a machine you share. You are
leaving with one that runs a thousand on hardware you asked for by name, and a written
record of what it cost.

This is also the moment to ask the question you have been saving. The room empties fast and
the answer is easier in person than over Slack.

## Stuck?

Put up a **red sticky** and talk it through with your table. Nudges, roughly in the order
they help:

<details markdown="1">
<summary>💡 What exactly does the ceiling forbid?</summary>

Write the two numbers next to each other: 992 filings, and a hard maximum of 512 tasks in
any one array.

So one array cannot have one task per filing. That is the only thing the limit rules out —
and notice how much it leaves open. Two of the three things in "992 filings, 512 tasks, one
array" are assumptions you chose, not rules Slurm imposed.

</details>

<details markdown="1">
<summary>💡 Does one task have to mean one filing?</summary>

On page 2 it did, because 100 filings fitted comfortably inside one array. Nothing in Slurm
requires it.

What is stopping a single task from handling several filings? And if it did, what would that
change about the `--time` you ask for?

</details>

<details markdown="1">
<summary>💡 What if one submission is not enough?</summary>

Suppose you submit twice. Every array starts numbering at 0, so the second submission's task
0 gets handed exactly the same number as the first submission's task 0 — and would therefore
process exactly the same filing.

What extra piece of information would the second submission need in order to work on a
different slice? And how could you get that information to it at submit time, without
editing the script in between?

</details>

<details markdown="1">
<summary>💡 How will you know it worked?</summary>

Decide the number you expect *before* it finishes: how many files should be in `results/`
when all 992 have been processed?

If you are short, you already have the machinery to fix it cheaply — that was page 3. And
per-task `.err` files tell you which tasks to look at rather than which array.
