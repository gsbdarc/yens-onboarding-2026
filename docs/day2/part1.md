# Part 1 — Profile & Submit a Job

Yesterday's script runs, on one filing at a time, on an interactive Yen node you share
with everyone else. This part is finding out what it actually costs — and then handing it
to the scheduler instead of holding a terminal open.

## Hands-On Lab

| | What you'll learn | Bonus |
|---|---|---|
| [1. Profile]({{ '/day2/profiling/' | relative_url }}) | Measure a script you have never seen, then the real workload over 10 filings | Profile two more scripts · size up your own machine |
| [2. Document]({{ '/day2/resource-profile/' | relative_url }}) | Put the three numbers in your README, where the next step reads them | Let Claude write it into the README |
| [3. Submit]({{ '/day2/submit-a-slurm-job/' | relative_url }}) | Read the live queue, then write `#SBATCH` directives by hand, submit, monitor and cancel | Other ways to run and inspect jobs · turn this into a Claude skill |
| [4. Read Logs]({{ '/day2/debug-a-failed-job/' | relative_url }}) | Submit a job that fails on purpose, and find out why from its `.err` | Three more broken jobs · let Claude read the log for you |

When all four are done, check yourself against the
[Part 1 Checkpoint]({{ '/day2/part1-checkpoint/' | relative_url }}) — nothing to run, just
the list Part 2 assumes you have.
