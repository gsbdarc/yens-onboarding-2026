## Computing Resources — A Quick Recap

Before we run anything, let's make sure we have the vocabulary for the resources a program
uses:

| Resource | What it is |
|---|---|
| **CPU core** | An individual worker that executes your code |
| **RAM** | Fast memory the CPU reads from while working |
| **Storage (file system)** | Where your files live — VAST on the Yens |
| **Time** | How long your script takes to finish |

---

## The Mystery Script

You are going to run a script you have never seen before and work out what resources it uses — without reading the code. That is **profiling**: measuring a script's time, CPU and RAM while it runs.

> **Task:** Run `mystery_script.py` and measure its resource usage in real time using two terminals — both on the **same Yen node**.

**Step 1 — Note which Yen you are on.**

In your current terminal, run:

```bash
hostname
```

You will see something like `yen2`. Remember this — your second terminal must connect to the exact same node.

**Step 2 — Open a second terminal on the same node.**

In the new terminal, SSH directly to that node by name (not the load-balanced `yen.stanford.edu`, which could land you on a different machine):

```bash
ssh SUNetID@yen2.stanford.edu   # replace yen2 with whatever hostname showed above
```

{: .note }
> Everything on this page runs from your clone, with the environment active:
>
> ```bash
> cd ~/yens-onboarding-2026
> source .venv/bin/activate
> ```

{: .note }
> 💡 **Skip the second login.** A fresh `ssh` means another password + Duo prompt. To avoid re-authenticating, open a terminal through JupyterHub instead: browse to that node's hub (e.g. `https://yen2.stanford.edu/jupyter/`), then **New → Terminal**. You're already authenticated there, and it drops you onto that exact node — ideal for the second monitoring terminal.

**Step 3 — Start `watch userload` in Terminal 2 *first*, before running anything.**

Terminal 2:
```bash
watch userload
```

- `userload` shows how many **cores** you're using and what **% of the node's memory** you're holding — your total footprint across all your processes on this node:

  ```text
  SUNetID  |  0.34 Cores  |  0.00% Mem  on yen2
  ```

- `watch` re-runs it every 2 seconds, so the numbers refresh live
- Jupyter processes are tracked separately from processes started in a terminal shell — not a Jupyter terminal — and are not included

**What are we seeing?** Right now — before you run anything — this is your **baseline**: **Cores** near 0 and **% Mem** near 0. That's what an idle account looks like. Keep this terminal visible; you'll watch these numbers move once the script starts. See the [current per-user limits](https://rcpedia.stanford.edu/_policies/user_limits/) for how much CPU and RAM any one user can use on an interactive Yen.

**Step 4 — Now run the script in Terminal 1 and watch Terminal 2 change.**

Terminal 1:
```bash
time python scripts/mystery_script.py
```

{: .note }
> **What's the `time` in front?** `time` is a wrapper — it runs whatever command follows (`python scripts/mystery_script.py`) exactly as normal, then, once it finishes, prints how long it took. It doesn't change what your script does; it just measures it. That's where the `real` / `user` / `sys` lines below come from.

As it runs, watch Terminal 2: **your Cores number climbs and % Mem grows** — that's the script's footprint stacking on top of your baseline. If Cores climbs above 1, the script is using more than one core at once. When it finishes, the numbers fall back toward baseline, and `time` prints three lines:

```
real    0m31.234s
user    2m0.682s
sys     0m2.212s
```

- **real** — wall-clock time: how long you actually waited
- **user** — CPU time your code consumed across all cores; if `user` > `real`, the script used multiple cores in parallel
- **sys** — CPU time spent on OS-level work (file I/O, memory allocation)

**Step 5 — Run the script again, this time watching it in `htop`.**

First, in **Terminal 2**, stop `watch userload` by pressing **`Ctrl+C`**. Then start `htop`, filtered to just your own processes:

```bash
htop -u SUNetID
```

The `-u` flag limits `htop` to your processes, so the hundreds of other users' processes on
the node don't drown yours out.

<details markdown="1">
<summary>🖥️ Options to hide the header and make the display more compact</summary>

Some Yens have 256 cores, and if `htop` is drawing one bar per core the header fills the
window and pushes the process list off the bottom.

- **`H`** — hide threads, so each process is one row
- **`t`** — tree mode, which nests the workers a process spawned underneath it. Useful
  here, because that nesting is exactly what you are trying to count

**To hide the header,** swap the per-core meters for a single average bar:

1. **`F2`** — opens Setup, with **Meters** already selected on the left
2. **`→`** to move into the **Left column** list
3. **`↓`** to the CPU entry — it reads something like `CPUs (1/1) [Bar]`
4. **`Delete`** to remove it
5. **`→`** again to reach **Available meters**, then **`↓`** to **CPU average**
6. **`Enter`** to add it back as one bar
7. **`F10`** to leave Setup

You only do this once — `htop` writes it to `~/.config/htop/htoprc` and remembers it next
time. If your header already shows a single `Avg[...]` bar, it is set up correctly and you
can skip this.

</details>

**Each row in `htop` is one process.** The columns that matter:

- **`CPU%`** — how hard that process is pushing. `100%` = one full core busy, `200%` = two cores, and so on — a single process reading over `100%` is spread across multiple cores.
- **`RES`** — the real RAM the process is actually using. Shown in **KB** by default, so `9000` ≈ **9 MB**; bigger values get an `M` or `G` suffix (like `111M`).
- **`MEM%`** — that same `RES` as a share of the **whole node's** RAM. On a 1 TB node a few MB rounds to **0.0%** — which is why `userload` can read `0% Mem` even though the process really is using memory.
- **`VIRT`** — ignore it. That's memory the process *reserved*, not what it's actually using.

Now, in **Terminal 1**, run the script again and watch your rows in `htop` light up:

```bash
time python scripts/mystery_script.py
```

As the script runs, watch new `python` rows appear — that's it spawning work. Count them to answer "how many processes did it run?"

**Think these through before you reveal the answer:**
- How long did it take, and how much RAM did it peak at?
- How many CPU cores did it use?
- How many processes did it run?
- Is it therefore **serial** (one core) or **parallel** (multiple)?

<details markdown="1">
<summary>✅ Check your answer</summary>

You saw about **4 `python` processes** in `htop` and roughly **4 Cores** in `userload` — no accident. Open `scripts/mystery_script.py` and you'll find `num_cores = 4`: the script deliberately starts 4 worker processes, one per core, which is exactly what made it a **parallel, multi-core** program. The amount of parallelism is a **choice in the code** — change that number and the processes and cores you'd see change with it.

> **Task:** Profile the real batch script on 10 filings using the same two-terminal technique.

Now apply the same technique to a **real workload**. `scripts/extract_form_3_batch.py` — committed in the repo, so everyone has it — runs the same Form 3 extraction you did on Day 1 with `extract_form_3_one_file.py`, but loops over many filings instead of one. Process **10 filings** and profile it. (If you finished the Day 1 capstone and have your own batch script, profile that one instead — the numbers are what matter, not whose script produced them.)

First, open the script so you know what you're profiling — `cat scripts/extract_form_3_batch.py` (or open it in JupyterHub).

<details markdown="1">
<summary>💡 Hint — what the script does</summary>

It loops over the filings in `data/aws_links.csv`, calls the API for each, and writes one JSON per filing to `results/`.

</details>

The script is set to process **10 filings** (see `NUM_FILINGS` near the top — kept small so a stray run doesn't fire hundreds of paid API calls).

**First run — watch the load.** Terminal 2 (start this first):
```bash
watch userload
```

Terminal 1 — run it and note the `real`, `user`, and `sys` times when it finishes:
```bash
time python scripts/extract_form_3_batch.py
```

**Second run — watch the processes.** Switch Terminal 2 to `htop`, then run the script once more so you can see the processes live:

Terminal 2:
```bash
htop -u SUNetID
```

Terminal 1:
```bash
time python scripts/extract_form_3_batch.py
```

Watch Terminal 2 as the 10 filings process one after another.

{: .note }
> **No need to clear `results/` first.** The script overwrites each file as it goes — there
> is no check for work already done, so the second run repeats all ten API calls whether or
> not the output is already sitting there.
>
> Worth noticing, because it is a real cost: a rerun after a partial failure pays for
> everything again. We will fix this later, in
> [Part 2]({{ '/day2/rerun-safe-tasks/' | relative_url }}).

{: .note }
> **Reminder — `real` / `user` / `sys`:**
> - **`real`** — wall-clock time: how long you actually waited
> - **`user`** — CPU time your code used across all cores (if `user` > `real`, it ran on multiple cores in parallel)
> - **`sys`** — CPU time spent on OS-level work (file I/O, memory allocation)

Think about each of these before revealing the answer:

<details markdown="1">
<summary>❓ Question 1</summary>

What did we observe in `userload` while the 10 filings ran — what happened to **Cores** and **% Mem**?

</details>

<details markdown="1">
<summary>❓ Question 2</summary>

Why do the **Cores** stay near 0, even with 10 filings running?

</details>

<details markdown="1">
<summary>❓ Question 3</summary>

Why does **% Mem** stay near 0?

</details>

<details markdown="1">
<summary>❓ Question 4</summary>

Is this script **serial** or **parallel**?

</details>

<details markdown="1">
<summary>✅ Check your answer</summary>

- **Cores and % Mem barely moved.** The job spends almost all its time **waiting on the Anthropic API** to answer, not computing — so it barely touches the CPU. That makes it an **I/O-bound** job (waiting on the network), unlike the mystery script, which was **CPU-bound** (doing math).
- **`% Mem` reading 0 is two things at once.** The script really does hold little memory, because it handles one filing at a time rather than loading all ten. But even a few hundred MB would still show `0%`, because that column measures your share of the node's whole ~1 TB. On a node that big, almost any single job rounds to zero — so read `RES` in `htop` when you want the real number.
- **`real` is large, `user` is small.** `real` (wall-clock) is big because you waited on the API; `user` (actual CPU time) is tiny because the CPU had little to do. That gap — `real` ≫ `user` — is the fingerprint of a job that mostly waits.

A typical run: `real 0m22.5s`, `user 0m1.9s`, `sys 0m0.5s` — about 2 seconds of real work, ~20 seconds spent waiting. In `htop` you'll see just **one `python` process**, and **under 1 Core** in `userload`.

Two more things worth knowing:

- **Per-filing times vary** — each takes however long the API takes, so 10 filings isn't exactly 10× one.
- **Why the script sets `OPENBLAS_NUM_THREADS=1`.** Libraries like NumPy and pandas try to speed up math by grabbing *every* core on the machine — 256 on Yen2, for example. But the Yens enforce [per-user limits](https://rcpedia.stanford.edu/_policies/user_limits/) on how much CPU one person can use, so grabbing all 256 doesn't help — it just crowds a pile of threads onto the cores you're actually allowed, which can make the job *slower*. Setting it to `1` keeps the job to what it needs. The habit: on a shared node, don't let a library grab the whole machine — keep its thread count within your limits.

</details>

<details markdown="1">
<summary>⭐ Bonus — if you finished early</summary>

**Bonus — Vectorized vs. Non-Vectorized**

One quick way to speed up scientific Python is **vectorization** — doing the math on a whole array in one operation instead of looping element-by-element in Python. The array operation runs in fast, pre-compiled code, so it's often 10–100× faster. We ship a script that computes the same sum of squares both ways — profile it and see the difference.

Terminal 1 — run it:
```bash
source .venv/bin/activate
time python scripts/vectorize_demo.py
```

Terminal 2 — watch the load while it runs:
```bash
watch userload
```

Both versions produce the identical result; the script prints how much faster the vectorized one was (often 10× or more). Notice the slow Python loop pins a core the whole time, while the NumPy version finishes almost before you can look at Terminal 2.

**Bonus — Change the number of cores**

Open `scripts/mystery_script.py` and change `num_cores = 4` to a different number — try **1**, or **8**. Then **profile it again** with the same two-terminal setup: run `time python scripts/mystery_script.py` in Terminal 1, and watch it in Terminal 2 with `watch userload` (or `htop -u SUNetID`).

Document what changes:

- How many `python` processes appear in `htop` now?
- How many **Cores** in `userload`?
- Did the `real` (wall-clock) time go up or down?
- Does the resource usage match the number you set?
