## Read the Queue First

Before you add a job to the queue, look at the queue.

{: .important }
> **Task:** Look at the live Slurm queue to see what jobs are waiting or running right now.

```bash
squeue
```

Look at the columns:
- **JOBID** — unique ID for each job
- **PARTITION** — which partition (queue) the job was submitted to — each partition has different node types, time limits, and resource caps; see the [current partitions and their limits](https://rcpedia.stanford.edu/_user_guide/slurm/#current-partitions-and-their-limits)
- **ST** — status: `R` = running, `PD` = pending (waiting in queue for resources)
- **TIME** — how long the job has been running
- **NODELIST** — which compute node it landed on

There is also a shorthand to filter to just your jobs:

```bash
squeue --me
```

You can also filter by partition — for example, to see only GPU jobs:

```bash
squeue -p gpu
```

Every `PD` job is waiting for a node with the resources it requested. When Slurm finds a matching node — it runs.

Now run `sinfo` to see the state of all nodes and the partitions they belong to:

```bash
sinfo
```

- How many compute nodes are currently idle (`STATE=idle`)?
- What partitions exist? Which one would you use for a normal job?
- What is the maximum time limit for each partition? See the
  [current partitions and their limits](https://rcpedia.stanford.edu/_user_guide/slurm/#current-partitions-and-their-limits).

## Write and Submit a Job

{: .important }
> **Task:** Build a Slurm job script line by line to run your Form 3 extraction script on a compute node.

**Start from a clean shell.** If you have a virtual environment active right now (you'll see `(.venv)` at the front of your prompt), deactivate it first:

```bash
deactivate
```

`sbatch` copies your current shell's environment into the job by default, so if `.venv` is active when you submit, it **rides along** — and the job can quietly succeed even if the script forgot to activate it. Deactivate first so the job runs on only what the **script** sets up — the way it'll run for a teammate, or for you from a clean login.

**Create the file:**

Your repo already has a `slurm/` folder (with a few prepared scripts). Just make sure a `logs/` folder exists for job output:

```bash
mkdir -p logs
```

{: .warning }
> **The `logs/` folder must exist before you submit.** Slurm opens your `--output`/`--error` files the moment the job starts — it does **not** create missing directories. If you point `--output` at `logs/…` but there's no `logs/` folder, the job **fails silently**: nothing runs and no log file appears to tell you why. Create it once, up front. If instead you point `--output` at a bare `extract.out` with no folder, the file lands in whatever directory you ran `sbatch` from.

Create a new file `slurm/extract_form_3_batch.slurm` and open it in your editor — you'll build it up line by line below.

{: .note }
> No preferred terminal editor? You can create it right in **JupyterHub**: in the file browser, open the `slurm/` folder, click **+ New → Text File** (or **File → New → Text File**), edit it in the browser, then **rename** the file to `extract_form_3_batch.slurm` and save with `Cmd/Ctrl+S`.

**Copy the next lines into the new file** — Steps 1 to 4 build it up in order. None of
them are commands to run in your terminal.

**Step 1 — The shebang**

The first line of every shell script is the **shebang**:

```bash
#!/bin/bash
```

The `#!` (the **shebang**) tells the operating system which **interpreter** — the program that reads your script and runs it line by line — to use for the rest of the file; here, the Bash shell at `/bin/bash`. Without it, the system doesn't know whether your script is Bash, Python, or something else. It has to be the very first line of the file.

**Step 2 — SBATCH directives**

These are instructions to the Slurm scheduler — add them at the top of the file, right after the shebang:

```bash
#SBATCH --job-name=<job-name>
#SBATCH --partition=normal
#SBATCH --output=logs/extract_%j.out
#SBATCH --error=logs/extract_%j.err
#SBATCH --time=<HH:MM:SS>
#SBATCH --mem=<RAM>
#SBATCH --cpus-per-task=<cores>
```

What each one is:

- `--job-name` — a short label **you pick** so you can spot this job in the queue (e.g. `form3-extract`). It doesn't affect resources; name it whatever's memorable.
- `--partition` — the queue the job runs in. `normal` is the default for CPU jobs; each partition has its own time limits and resource caps (see the [current partitions and their limits](https://rcpedia.stanford.edu/_user_guide/slurm/#current-partitions-and-their-limits)).
- `--output` / `--error` — files where the job's normal output and errors get written; `%j` is auto-filled with the job ID, so each run gets its own log. **Leave these as-is.**
- `--time`, `--mem`, `--cpus-per-task` — the resources you're **requesting**. Fill these in from the **time**, **RAM**, and **CPU cores** you recorded in your Profiling README.

{: .warning }
> **The `<...>` are placeholders — delete the angle brackets too.** Replace the whole thing,
> brackets included: `--time=00:30:00`, not `--time=<00:30:00>`. Slurm reads a leftover `<`
> as part of the value and rejects the directive.

{: .note }
> **About the `--output` and `--error` files:**
> - A batch job has **no terminal** — you're not watching it run. So Slurm redirects everything your script would normally print: normal output goes to the **`--output` (`.out`) file**, and error messages/tracebacks go to the **`--error` (`.err`) file**. Those files are how you see what the job did and debug it when it fails.
> - `%j` gets replaced with the job ID, so each run writes its own `logs/extract_JOBID.out` and `.err` instead of overwriting the last.
> - **Combine them if you like:** omit `--error` entirely and Slurm sends *both* normal output and errors to the single `--output` (`.out`) file. Keeping them separate just makes errors easier to spot.
> - The `logs/` directory must exist before the job runs — Slurm won't create it, which is why `mkdir -p logs` came first.

**Step 3 — Set up the environment**

Still writing into the file, not typing in your terminal. These two lines run later, on the
compute node, when the job starts:

```bash
# Navigate to your project
cd $HOME/yens-onboarding-2026

# Activate your virtual environment
source .venv/bin/activate
```

{: .note }
> **What's already installed.** Your `.venv` was built from `requirements.txt` on Day 1. Once it's activated, any job can use these packages:
>
> | Package | Used for |
> |---|---|
> | `anthropic` | Calling the Anthropic API (LLM extraction) |
> | `python-dotenv` | Loading your API key from `.env` |
> | `pydantic` | Validating and structuring the LLM output |
> | `pandas` | Tabular data |
> | `numpy` | Vectorized numerics (installed with pandas) |
> | `requests` | Downloading filings over HTTP |
> | `ipykernel` / `jupyter` | Notebook and JupyterHub kernels |
> | `matplotlib` | Plots |
>
> Need something else? `pip install` it into your `.venv` and add it to `requirements.txt` so your work stays reproducible.

**Step 4 — Add the line that runs your script**

The last line of the file is the actual work — the command Slurm will run on the compute node when the job starts. It's a line you write *inside* the script, **not** something you run yourself right now:

```bash
python scripts/extract_form_3_batch.py
```

This runs the **10-filing batch you profiled** — `scripts/extract_form_3_batch.py` loops over `NUM_FILINGS` (10) SEC Form 3 filings from `data/aws_links.csv` — so the `--time`, `--mem`, and `--cpus-per-task` you filled in above come straight from your Profiling README.

Save the file. Here's the whole script, with its four parts labeled:

*Every Slurm script has these four parts: the **shebang**, the **`#SBATCH`** directives (requests to the scheduler, not commands that run), the **environment setup** that runs on the compute node, and the **run line(s)** that do the actual work.*

{: .warning }
> **Slurm starts a fresh shell on the compute node.** Your virtual environment is not active. Your working directory is not set. Every setup step must be in the script — `cd`, `source .venv/bin/activate`, and any `module load` commands you need. If it works interactively on the Yens but fails as a job, a missing setup step is usually why.

### Submit it

{: .important }
> **Today only:** this class has a dedicated Slurm reservation, `class`. Add `--reservation=class` to every `sbatch` (and `srun`) command today so your jobs run on the reserved nodes. It's a class-day flag — drop it for your own work after today.

```bash
sbatch --reservation=class slurm/extract_form_3_batch.slurm
# Submitted batch job 12345678
```

Monitor the queue:

```bash
squeue --me
```

### Cancel it

```bash
scancel JOBID
```

Replace `JOBID` with your job's actual number — the one `sbatch` printed (`Submitted batch job 12345678`) and that shows in `squeue --me`. It's not the literal word `JOBID`.

Confirm it is gone:

```bash
squeue --me
```

{: .note }
> You may briefly see your job's status change to **CG** (completing) before it disappears from the queue — that's normal, not an error.

### Add email notifications

Slurm can email you when the job starts and finishes. That needs two more `#SBATCH`
directives — and rather than typing them, have Claude Code add them.

**Start Claude Code** on the Yens:

```bash
ml claude-code
cd ~/yens-onboarding-2026
claude
```

**Then ask it** — replacing `SUNetID` with your own:

```
> Add --mail-type=ALL and --mail-user=SUNetID@stanford.edu to the #SBATCH directives in slurm/extract_form_3_batch.slurm
```

{: .warning }
> **Use your own SUNet ID.** If the literal text `SUNetID@stanford.edu` ends up in the
> script, the job still runs and still reports success — the email just goes nowhere, and
> nothing tells you. Check the line before you resubmit.

Claude will show you the change before writing it. Approve it, then `/exit` to leave Claude
and get your shell back. The two lines it should have added:

```bash
#SBATCH --mail-type=ALL
#SBATCH --mail-user=SUNetID@stanford.edu
```

`ALL` sends an email when the job starts, ends, and fails — including a utilization summary showing how much CPU and RAM it actually used.

Resubmit:

```bash
sbatch --reservation=class slurm/extract_form_3_batch.slurm
```

Once your job runs, check your inbox. You should receive two emails: one when the job **starts** and one when it **ends**. The start email tells you when it began — compare that to when you submitted to see how long it **waited in the queue**. The end email includes a **utilization summary** (how much CPU time and memory the job actually used) and the job's **exit status**: `0` means success; any other value means it failed.

<details markdown="1">
<summary>⭐ Bonus — if you finished early</summary>

**Bonus — Go Interactive Instead of Batch**

Everything so far has been batch submission — write a script, `sbatch` it, wait. Slurm also supports an interactive allocation on a dedicated node — handy when you're debugging and re-running over and over: you hold the allocation, so you don't re-queue for resources every time a job fails and you fix it:

```bash
srun --reservation=class --pty --cpus-per-task=2 --mem=4G --time=00:30:00 bash
```

Your interactive session is a Slurm job like any other — run `squeue --me` and you'll see it listed (state `R`) until you release it:

```bash
squeue --me
```

Once it drops you into a shell on your allocated node, you're on a fresh shell — do the same setup your batch script does, then run the script directly:

```bash
cd $HOME/yens-onboarding-2026   # into your project
source .venv/bin/activate                   # activate your environment
python scripts/extract_form_3_batch.py   # run it and watch the output live
```

Because you're interactive, you see the output as it happens and can re-run instantly after a fix — no re-queuing. Type `exit` to release the allocation when you're done.

**Bonus — Watch a Job Run on Its Node**

`slurm/mystery.slurm` runs the mystery script from Profiling for about **30 seconds** across a few cores — long enough to watch it live.

Submit it:

```bash
sbatch --reservation=class slurm/mystery.slurm
```

While your job is running you can SSH to the node it's on and watch it work. (Nodes are **shared** — other users' jobs run on them too — but your job has its own **dedicated cores and RAM**.)

First, run `squeue --me` to find which node it landed on — the `NODELIST` column (e.g. `yen10`):

```bash
squeue --me
```

Then SSH to that node and watch your processes live:

```bash
ssh SUNetID@yen10   # use your job's actual node
htop -u SUNetID                  # or: top -u SUNetID
```

You'll see the mystery script's Python workers pinning the cores you requested. Press `q` to quit `htop`, then `exit` to leave the node.

{: .note }
> You can only SSH to a compute node **while you have a job running on it** — once the job ends (or if you never had one there), SSH to that node is refused. You can't hop onto arbitrary compute nodes.

**Bonus — Chain Two Jobs**

A real research pipeline is a chain of **stages**, each feeding the next. Scaled up, your Form 3 work is naturally two jobs: **(1) extract** the structured fields with the API (what your batch script does), then **(2) aggregate** the per-filing JSON into one dataset and compute summary stats. The second stage reads what the first one wrote, so it cannot start until the extractions land. Rather than babysit them, launching each by hand the moment the last finishes, you queue the whole chain at once: `--dependency=afterok` tells Slurm to hold each job until the one before it **succeeds**. Your repo ships a small two-step version of this:

- `scripts/chain_step1.py` — crunches numbers for ~2 minutes, then writes its result to `/scratch/users/SUNetID/chain_demo/step1_result.txt`.
- `scripts/chain_step2.py` — reads that file and does ~30 seconds more math, writing `step2_result.txt` beside it.

with `slurm/chain_step1.slurm` and `slurm/chain_step2.slurm` to run them.

**Step 1 — read both job scripts first** so you know what you're submitting. Notice they're ordinary Slurm scripts, and that step 2 reads the file step 1 wrote:

```bash
cat slurm/chain_step1.slurm slurm/chain_step2.slurm
```

**Step 2 — have Claude add the email lines to step 2** *before* you submit, so you get a note when the chain finishes:

> Add `#SBATCH --mail-type=ALL` and `#SBATCH --mail-user=SUNetID@stanford.edu` to `slurm/chain_step2.slurm`.

**Step 3 — submit both back-to-back.** Step 1 runs for ~2 minutes, so fire them off one after the other and let it crunch while step 2 queues behind it. Submit step 1 and note the `JOBID` it prints:

```bash
sbatch --reservation=class slurm/chain_step1.slurm
```

Then submit step 2 right away, chained to the first — replace `JOBID` with step 1's ID:

```bash
sbatch --reservation=class --dependency=afterok:JOBID slurm/chain_step2.slurm
```

**Step 4 — watch the queue.** Both jobs are in, but step 2 waits its turn. `watch` re-runs a command every couple of seconds, so you can see the handoff happen live:

```bash
watch squeue --me
```

Step 1 shows `R` (running) while step 2 sits `PD` with reason `(Dependency)`. When step 1 finishes, step 2 flips to `R` on its own — you do nothing. Press `Ctrl-C` to stop watching.

{: .note }
> 💡 If step 1 **fails**, `afterok` is never satisfied, so step 2's reason in `squeue` changes from `(Dependency)` to `(DependencyNeverSatisfied)`. That job will never run — but it won't clear itself either. It sits in the queue until **you** cancel it with `scancel JOBID`. Clear it, fix step 1, then requeue the chain.

**Step 5 — check the handoff** once both are done:

```bash
cat /scratch/users/SUNetID/chain_demo/step2_result.txt
```

Step 2's number is computed from step 1's — proof the scratch file passed between them. Had step 1 failed, step 2 would never have started.

**Bonus — The `dev` partition**

The Yens have a dedicated **`dev` partition** for short, interactive debugging jobs — quick test runs while you're getting a script working, **not** production runs. It has tighter time limits but is meant to turn around fast, so you're not stuck in the main queue while iterating. Learn more: [Yen Slurm partitions](https://rcpedia.stanford.edu/_user_guide/slurm/#current-partitions-and-their-limits).

<details markdown="1">
<summary>📋 Show steps</summary>

Fire a quick throwaway job at `dev` with `-p dev` (and `--wrap`, which runs an inline command as a job). It's tiny, so it schedules fast, and it emails you when it finishes:

```bash
sbatch --reservation=class -p dev --mail-type=ALL --mail-user=SUNetID@stanford.edu --wrap="hostname; sleep 30"
```

Watch it — `dev` usually starts right away:

```bash
squeue --me
```

You'll get a completion email in a moment. Confirm it says the job completed.

</details>

**Bonus — Add a `longsqueue` alias**

The default `squeue` output is sparse. Pass a custom format to see what each job actually
requested — CPU cores, memory, and time limit:

```bash
squeue -o "%.18i %.9P %.8j %.8u %.8T %.10M %.10l %.4C %.7m %.15R"
```

The columns are: job ID, partition, job name, user, state, time elapsed, time limit, CPU
cores requested, memory requested, and reason/node.

To keep it, append an alias. The quoted heredoc (`<<'EOF'`) means nothing inside needs
escaping — paste the whole block at once:

```bash
cat >> ~/.bash_profile <<'EOF'
alias longsqueue='squeue -o "%.18i %.9P %.8j %.8u %.8T %.10M %.10l %.4C %.7m %.15R"'
EOF
source ~/.bash_profile
```

Now run `longsqueue`. If the alias comes back "not found", check the tail of the file with
`tail -3 ~/.bash_profile` before appending again.

**Bonus — Inspect any job with `scontrol`**

Pick any job from `squeue` and look up its full details:

```bash
scontrol show job JOBID
```

Three fields to pick out of the output:

| Field | What it tells you |
|---|---|
| `NumCPUs` | How many CPU cores the job asked for |
| `mem=` | How much RAM it asked for |
| `TimeLimit` | The wall-clock limit it gets killed at |

Works on any job — yours or anyone else's — as long as it is still queued or running.

**Bonus — Compare partitions**

Run `sinfo -p gpu` and `sinfo -p normal` to compare node counts and time limits.

`sinfo` does not show the per-user **caps** — the ceiling on how much any one person can
hold at once. Those live in the partition's **QoS** ("quality of service"), the policy
Slurm attaches to each partition saying how much of it a single user may take. Compare the
two with `sacctmgr show qos gpu` against `sacctmgr show qos normal` (or read the

<summary>⭐ Bonus — turn this into a Claude skill</summary>

You just wrote a Slurm script by hand and got it working. That working setup is the raw
material for a **skill** — a set of standing instructions Claude picks up automatically, so
it follows your conventions without you re-explaining them.

You are the reviewer throughout: you submit and check the work, not Claude.

### Two homes for a skill

Every skill is a **directory** holding one file named exactly `SKILL.md`. The directory
name is the skill's name — lowercase letters, digits and hyphens only — and it is also how
you invoke it: `yen-slurm/` gives you the `/yen-slurm` command.

Where the directory lives decides its scope:

- **Global skill** → `~/.claude/skills/<skill-name>/SKILL.md` — in your **home** directory (`~/.claude/`), so it loads in *every* project you work on. Best for **conventions that follow you** across projects (like how the Yens work).
- **Project skill** → `<your-repo>/.claude/skills/<skill-name>/SKILL.md` — in the **repo's own** `.claude/` (no `~/`), so it loads only in *this* repo and, once committed, ships to anyone who clones it. Best for **repo-specific** conventions — where results land, which script owns which stage, the naming your collaborators expect.

*Same `.claude/skills/` layout, two different homes: the **global** skill in `~/.claude/` follows you into every project; the **project** skill in the repo's `.claude/` is committed and ships to anyone who clones it.*


### Write a Global Skill

{: .important }
> **Task:** Have Claude distill a **global** Yen skill from the Slurm job you just ran by hand, then invoke it on a fresh job.

You'll do this from Claude Code running on the Yens. Load the module and launch it inside your repo:

```bash
ml claude-code
cd ~/yens-onboarding-2026
claude
```

#### A global skill — distilled from the job you just ran

You already got a batch Slurm script working by hand. Rather than describe the Yen conventions from scratch, point Claude at that script and have it **capture the reusable parts**:

> Read `slurm/extract_form_3_batch.slurm` and turn its reusable **Yen conventions** into a **global** skill at `~/.claude/skills/yen-slurm/SKILL.md`: partition choice, email, `%j` log naming, always setting `--time`/`--mem`/`--cpus-per-task`, and checking current limits on [RCpedia](https://rcpedia.stanford.edu/_user_guide/slurm/#current-partitions-and-their-limits). Keep it short and **repo-agnostic** — no project paths.

**Check what it wrote.** A good skill is short, and its **`description`** is what makes Claude reach for it later — so open the file and read it:

```bash
cat ~/.claude/skills/yen-slurm/SKILL.md
```

It should look something like this — a little frontmatter, then a few bullet conventions:

```markdown
# ~/.claude/skills/yen-slurm/SKILL.md
---
name: yen-slurm
description: Write and check Slurm batch scripts for Stanford's Yen cluster — partitions, email, %j logs, resource requests. Use when writing a .slurm job.
---

When writing a Yen job script:
- Choose a partition: `normal` for production, `dev` for short jobs (limits on RCpedia)
- Always set `--time`, `--mem`, and `--cpus-per-task`
- Email on completion: `--mail-type=ALL`, `--mail-user=SUNetID@stanford.edu`
- Name logs `logs/<job-name>_%j.out` and `.err`
```

The **`description` is the trigger** — Claude reads it to decide when to pull the skill in. Leave it vague ("slurm stuff") and it won't fire when you need it; say what it does *and when to use it*.

Then invoke it on a fresh job. Claude Code turns each skill's folder name into a `/`-command, so the `yen-slurm/` folder gives you `/yen-slurm` — type it and add your request:

> /yen-slurm write a Slurm job for a new run and save it as `slurm/extract_form_3_batch_claude.slurm`

**Submit and review:** the conventions should come straight from the skill, matching what you hand-wrote.

{: .warning }
> **You're still the reviewer.** A skill makes Claude follow your conventions, but Claude can still invent partition names, time limits, or per-user caps that don't exist. Check its choices against RCpedia — the [current partitions and their limits](https://rcpedia.stanford.edu/_user_guide/slurm/#current-partitions-and-their-limits) page and `sacctmgr show qos <partition>` — and against your own profiling.
