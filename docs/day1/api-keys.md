# Managing API Keys

An API key lets your code use a service and charge requests to an account. You'll copy
the course's Anthropic key into a `.env` file in your repo on the Yens, check that Git
ignores it, and load it in Python.

> **Start in your SSH terminal connected to the Yens.** A JupyterHub terminal works too.
> You'll switch to a notebook in Step 5.
>
> Use the course's **direct Anthropic API key**. Your Stanford education account and a
> Stanford Gateway key are separate from this credential.

## Step 1: Keep Configuration Out of Code

Avoid putting a key directly in code. This example uses a placeholder:

```python
import anthropic

client = anthropic.Anthropic(api_key="REPLACE_WITH_REAL_KEY")
```

If you replace the placeholder with a real key, anyone who receives the file receives
the key too. Deleting it later does not remove earlier copies or Git commits.

A `.env` file holds environment-variable assignments outside your program:

```text
ANTHROPIC_API_KEY=<secret value>
```

Your code reads the value by name when it runs. Share the code and keep the credential
file out of Git.

> A Python **virtual environment** is a directory containing an isolated interpreter and
> packages. An **environment variable** is a named runtime setting. A `.env` file stores
> settings that a library such as `python-dotenv` can load as environment variables.

## Step 2: Check the Shared Credential File

The instructor provides the course key in a shared file on the Yens. View it in your
own terminal:

```bash
cat /scratch/shared/yens-onboarding-2026/.env
```
{: .yens }

You'll see `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY=` followed by the course key.

## Step 3: Copy It to the Repository Root

```bash
cd ~/yens-onboarding-2026
cp /scratch/shared/yens-onboarding-2026/.env .env
ls -a
```
{: .yens }

Look for `.env` in the listing. Keep this file at the repo root so the notebook below
can load it.

{: .note }
> **Files starting with a dot are hidden by default.** A plain `ls` won't show `.env`
> or `.gitignore`; use `ls -a` to include them. Hidden files still work normally, and
> being hidden does not protect their contents.

## Step 4: Check That Git Ignores It

The repo's `.gitignore` already includes `.env`. Check that the rule applies:

```bash
git check-ignore -v .env
```
{: .yens }

The command should print the matching `.gitignore` rule. You can also check how Git sees
the file:

```bash
git status --short --ignored .env
```
{: .yens }

`!! .env` means ignored.

If no ignore rule appears, add `.env` to `.gitignore` before committing your work.

## Step 5: Load It in Python

First, create the notebook folder from your Yen terminal:

```bash
cd ~/yens-onboarding-2026
mkdir -p day1
```
{: .yens }

Then open [JupyterHub](https://yen1.stanford.edu/jupyter/hub/home), or return to your
existing browser session:

1. Open **`yens-onboarding-2026/day1`** in the file browser.
2. Use the **blue "+"** Launcher button to create a **GSB AI 2026** notebook.
3. Name it **`anthropic_test.ipynb`**. You'll continue using it in the next section.
4. Run this cell with **Shift+Enter**:

```python
import os
from dotenv import load_dotenv

load_dotenv("../.env")
print("ANTHROPIC_API_KEY loaded:", bool(os.getenv("ANTHROPIC_API_KEY")))
```

Expected output: `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY loaded: True`.

This confirms that the variable has a value. It does not check whether the service
accepts the key; the next section tests that with an API call.

<details markdown="1">
<summary>Loading the key in a script</summary>

A script at the repository root can use:

```python
from dotenv import load_dotenv

load_dotenv()
```

`python-dotenv` reads the file and adds its settings to the current Python process's
environment. It does not change your source code or activate a virtual environment.
By default, it keeps any value already set in that process.

{: .note }
> Viewing the file in your own terminal is fine. Keep the key out of shared screenshots,
> chats, and notebook output, since notebook output is saved with the file.

## Step 6: Initialize the Anthropic Client

In the same notebook, run a new cell:

```python
import anthropic

client = anthropic.Anthropic()
```

The client reads `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` from the environment and uses Anthropic's API
endpoint. You do not need to put the key in the constructor.

Confirm that the object exists without making a paid request:

```python
print(type(client).__name__)
```

Expected output: `Anthropic`. Creating the client does not send a model request.

Continue to [Extracting Data with an LLM]({{ '/day1/extracting-data-with-an-llm/' | relative_url }})
to make the first API call.

### Common Errors

| Symptom | Likely cause | Check |
|---|---|---|
| `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY loaded: False` | Wrong `.env` path or missing value | In a notebook cell, run `import os; print(os.getcwd())`. This notebook belongs in the repo's `day1/` folder and loads `../.env` |
| HTTP `401` on the next section's API call | Invalid or revoked key | Ask the instructor to confirm the key. After replacing `.env`, restart the notebook kernel and rerun the setup cells |
| `.env` appears in `git status` | Ignore rule missing or file was already tracked | Stop and ask an instructor before committing |

## If You Share a Key Accidentally

Tell the instructor or key owner so they can replace it. If it was committed to Git,
removing it from the latest file does not remove it from earlier commits.

<details markdown="1">
<summary>What else belongs in .env?</summary>

- API keys and access tokens
- database connection credentials
- cloud credentials
- machine-specific paths or service endpoints
- environment-specific settings such as an output directory

Secrets always belong outside source. Non-secret settings may also live in environment
variables when they differ between a laptop, the Yens, and a production job.

## Skills Learned

- Keep `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` in `.env`, not in code or notebook output
- Load the key from `.env` and check that Python can find it
- Check that Git ignores `.env` before committing
- Initialize the Anthropic client using the loaded environment variable
- Ask the key owner to replace a key if it is shared accidentally
