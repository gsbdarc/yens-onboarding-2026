# Git & GitHub for Research


Version control tracks every change you make to a project — who changed what, when, and why — so nothing is ever lost and you can roll back to any earlier state. In this course, your version history is also how you submit your work. This section sets up Git and GitHub and walks through the core workflow.

---

## Git and GitHub

**Git** is version control software that runs on your machine (or the Yens). It tracks every change you make to a project — who, what, and when — and lets you roll back to any previous state.

**GitHub** is a website that hosts git repositories in the cloud. It's where you share, back up, and submit your work.

Git saves your work as **commits** — snapshots of your whole project at a moment in time, each with a short message describing what changed. Your history is a chain of these snapshots, and you can return to any earlier one at any time.

*Each dot is one commit — a saved snapshot. The chain runs oldest (left) to newest (right).*

A **branch** is a **git** feature that lets you build a *separate* line of commits without disturbing your main work. You branch off, commit there, and merge back when the work is ready — so a risky experiment never touches your working version.

*Three numbered steps: **① fork** — make your own copy of the course repo on GitHub · **② clone** — download that copy to the Yens, where you actually work · **③ push** — send your finished work back up to your fork.*

Each day's challenge is submitted with a `git push` to your fork as proof of work. No push, no submission.

You've now met the two core **git** ideas — commits and branches. Two more features come from **GitHub** (the hosting side) and show up later in the course:

- **Issue** — a written note attached to the repo: a task to do, a bug you hit, a question to revisit. Issues are timestamped and searchable, so they can serve as a running log if you choose to use them that way.
- **Pull request (PR)** — a proposal to merge one branch into another. It shows exactly what changed and lets you (or a collaborator) review the changes before they become part of the main version.

Version control isn't just bookkeeping — it offers a few concrete advantages for research:

{: .tip }
> **Why version control helps research:**
> - **A readable history of what changed and why.** Every commit carries a short message. Instead of guessing what a file used to hold, you scroll its history and read *"clean data: drop 3 duplicate rows"* right next to the exact lines that changed.
> - **No more filename soup.** You don't need `analysis_final_v2_USETHIS_edited.R` to keep track of versions. There's one `analysis.R`, and its history holds every past version with an explanation of each change. The filename says *what the file is*; the history says *how it got there*.
> - **Experiment safely on a branch.** Try a risky reanalysis without touching your working results. If it doesn't pan out, the branch is a record of what you tried rather than a mess to clean up.
> - **Project management, even if you barely write code.** GitHub's issues and pull requests aren't only for software teams — you can use issues to track to-dos, data questions, or bugs, and pull requests to review a change before it's merged into your main version.
> - **Backed up and shareable.** Every version is recoverable, and pushing to GitHub backs your work up and lets a collaborator — or your future self — pick it up.

Version control is powerful, but it isn't a cure-all. A few honest caveats:

{: .warning }
> **Caveats:**
> - **Git has a steep learning curve.** It's genuinely confusing for newcomers — expect to lean on notes, cheatsheets, and AI tools at first.
> - **GitHub is a commercial product.** It's owned by Microsoft, not a community-run open project. Convenient and widely used, but not neutral infrastructure.
> - **Git is a poor fit for versioning data.** It's built to track line-by-line changes in text and code; large or binary data files make the repository slow and bloated.
> - **GitHub is not for datasets** — especially large ones. It enforces file-size limits and isn't meant for data storage. Keep data on the cluster (`/yen/projects`, `/scratch`) or in a data repository, not in your GitHub repo.

## Exercise

Your work in this course is tracked in your version history. Set up your copy of the course repo and make your first commit now.

{: .important }
> **Exercise:** Fork the course repo, clone it to the Yens, authenticate with GitHub, create a branch, commit a file, and push it back to your fork.

**Step 1 — Fork the course repo**

A **fork** is your own copy of the course repo, living under your GitHub account. Everything you write over the next two days goes here — it's yours to keep after the course ends.

1. **Fork the repo.** Go to the [course repo on GitHub](https://github.com/gsbdarc/yens-onboarding-2026) and click **Fork** in the top-right corner.
2. **Turn on Issues.** On your fork: **Settings → General → Features → tick *Issues***. A fork starts with its issue tracker switched off, and you'll be logging issues later today — the `github-for-research` skill depends on it.

{: .note }
> You do **not** need to enable Actions or Pages on your fork. The course site is
> published from the class repo; your fork is a working copy for your own code.

**Step 2 — Clone to the Yens**

**Cloning** downloads your fork onto the machine you're working on — here, the Yens.

```bash
cd ~
git clone https://github.com/YOUR_GITHUB_USERNAME/yens-onboarding-2026.git
cd yens-onboarding-2026
```

{: .note }
> 🟢 **Green sticky** = I'm done and ready &nbsp;&nbsp; 🔴 **Red sticky** = I need help
>
> Put a sticky note on your laptop lid so instructors can see where you are.

**Step 3 — Authenticate with GitHub (one time)**

Pushing to your fork has to prove it's really you. You do that with a **Personal Access Token (PAT)** — a single-purpose password for the command line — handed to the **GitHub CLI** (`gh`) once. After that, git just works. There's no browser on the Yens, so a token is the simplest way in.

**Make one now — it takes two minutes.** If you already have a token from previous work,
have it to hand instead and skip to `gh auth login` below.

Do this in your browser, on your laptop:

1. Open this pre-filled link: **[Create your token](https://github.com/settings/tokens/new?scopes=repo,workflow,read:org&description=yen-repo-workflow)**. It's a **classic** token with the three scopes you need already checked — **`repo`** (push to your fork), **`workflow`** (lets you push changes to the GitHub Actions files), and **`read:org`** (lets the GitHub CLI sign you in) — and named `yen-repo-workflow`.
2. Set the **expiration** to **1 year** — long enough to reuse this token for your research work well beyond this course, with an automatic backstop if it's ever forgotten or leaked.
3. Click **Generate token**, then **copy it right away** — GitHub shows it only once.

{: .warning }
> Treat the token like a password: don't commit it, don't paste it into a file, don't share it. If it ever leaks, delete it on GitHub and make a new one.

*Give the token to `gh` — on the Yens:*

```bash
ml gh-cli           # make gh available on the Yens
gh auth login       # answer: GitHub.com → HTTPS → Authenticate Git → Yes → Paste an authentication token
gh auth setup-git   # let gh remember the token so git never asks you again
```

Paste the token when `gh auth login` asks. The `gh auth setup-git` step then wires `gh` in as git's credential helper, so it hands over your token automatically on every `git push` — no browser, no device code, and no password prompt, now or in future sessions.

<details markdown="1">
<summary>Setting up <code>gh</code> on your own laptop</summary>

You'll want `gh` on your laptop too (for the Claude Code work later). Install it, then run the same `gh auth login` and paste the **same token**:

- **macOS** (Homebrew): `brew install gh`
- **Windows** (in PowerShell — then it's usable from Git Bash too): `winget install --id GitHub.cli`
- **Linux** / other: see the [official instructions](https://github.com/cli/cli#installation)

```bash
gh auth login    # GitHub.com → HTTPS → Paste an authentication token
```

(On a laptop you *can* instead choose "Login with a web browser" — but the token works everywhere, so reusing it is one less thing to think about.)

</details>

**Step 4 — Create a branch**

A **branch** is a safe, separate workspace, so your experiments never disturb the main version of your work.

```bash
git checkout -b experiment
```

**Step 5 — Make a change and commit**

`add` chooses which changes go into your next snapshot; `commit` saves that snapshot with a message describing what changed and why.

```bash
echo "Hello from Day 1" > my_first_commit.txt
git add my_first_commit.txt
git commit -m "Add my first commit from Day 1"
```

**Step 6 — Push to your fork**

**Pushing** sends your saved snapshots up to your fork on GitHub — where they're backed up and, later, where your submitted work can be checked.

```bash
git push -u origin experiment
```

{: .note }
> This pushes your **branch**, not `main`. Your work is safely on GitHub, but `main` is untouched — which is exactly the point of branching. To fold the branch into `main`, open a pull request on your fork and merge it.

{: .important }
> Each day's capstone is handed in the same way — a `git push` to your fork. Come back to these steps whenever you need to save work.
