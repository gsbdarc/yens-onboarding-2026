# Connecting to the Yens

SSH lets you connect from your laptop to a remote computer and run commands there
as if you were sitting at it. In this section you will log in to the Yens for the
first time. Where your files go once you are there is the next section,
[Your Data on the Yens]({{ '/day1/your-data/' | relative_url }}).

{: .important }
> **Do this section first — give it about 10 minutes.** Everything else in Day 1 runs on
> the Yens, so nothing later will work until this does. All you need is a terminal: the
> built-in **Terminal** app on macOS, or [Git Bash](https://git-scm.com/downloads) on
> Windows.
>
> If your login does not work, put up a red sticky rather than reading ahead. An account
> that was never provisioned is the one problem on this page you cannot solve on your own —
> flag it and an instructor will come to you.

## Why Use a Server at All?

Your laptop is fine for writing code and running small tests. But research computing regularly runs into limits that a laptop cannot handle:

| Situation | What happens on a laptop | What happens on the Yens |
|-----------|--------------------------|--------------------------|
| Dataset is 80 GB | Out of memory, script crashes | Loads fine — 250 GB–3 TB RAM per node |
| Analysis takes 12 hours | Laptop sleeps, WiFi drops, run dies | Job keeps running — always on, always connected |
| Need to run 100 jobs in parallel | One at a time, ties up your machine | Submit all 100 at once via the scheduler |
| Data is restricted (IRB, NDA) | Must stay on Stanford systems | Yens are Stanford-managed infrastructure |
| Collaborating with your PI | "Can you send me the data?" | PI already has access to `/yen/projects/` |

The Yens are available to all researchers at GSB — faculty, PhD students, post-docs, and research staff alike. This section is where you start using them.

## What Is a Remote Server?

Your laptop is powerful but limited: one machine, one location, and it has to be open and plugged in for work to run. A **remote server** is a computer you connect to over the network — it's always on, more powerful than your laptop, and your work keeps running after you close the lid.

**What are the Yens?**

The Yens are a 17-node shared research computing cluster: 5 interactive nodes you SSH into directly, and 12 nodes accessible only through the SLURM scheduler (Day 2). All 17 nodes share the same file system — a file you write on yen1 is instantly visible on every other node.

*Your laptop and the Yens are two separate computers; **SSH** is the connection between them. When you log in you land on one of the shared **interactive Yens** (yen1–yen5) — fine for light work. The powerful **SLURM compute nodes** come later, on Day 2, reached through a scheduler rather than directly. Whichever node you're on, you see the same shared files.*

`ssh` opens an encrypted tunnel: you type locally, commands execute remotely, output streams back to your screen. The interactive Yens are shared — per-user CPU and RAM limits are enforced automatically. See the [current limits](https://rcpedia.stanford.edu/_policies/user_limits/) for details. For heavier jobs, the SLURM scheduler (Day 2) gives you dedicated compute nodes.

**What's inside a Yen server:**

![Server hardware diagram showing CPU, cores, and RAM — Yen1 has 256 cores]({{ "/assets/images/server-hardware-cpu-ram.png" | relative_url }})

The **CPU** is the processor chip. **Cores** are the individual workers inside it — each core runs instructions independently, which is what makes parallel work possible. **RAM** holds the data the CPU is actively using. The Yen servers vary in size — see the [current specs on RCPedia](https://rcpedia.stanford.edu/_getting_started/yen-servers/#overview-of-the-yen-computing-infrastructure) for details.

## Exercise — Log In

Log in to the Yens for the first time and get your bearings.

{: .important }
> **Task:** Connect to the Yens cluster over SSH, identify which interactive Yen you landed on, and read the login banner.

**Connect:**
```bash
ssh SUNetID@yen.stanford.edu
```

Replace `SUNetID` with your Stanford username. When prompted for your password, type your Stanford password (nothing will appear — that's normal). You will be prompted for Duo two-factor authentication.

**Identify your node:**
```bash
hostname      # e.g. yen1, yen2, yen3, yen4, or yen5
whoami        # confirm you are logged in as yourself
```

{: .note }
> The Yens (yen1–yen5) are shared interactive compute servers. You land on whichever one the load balancer picks. They're powerful, but shared — read the login banner when you connect, it describes current usage policies.

**Read the banner, then look around:**
```bash
ls ~                              # your home directory on the Yens
pwd                               # /home/users/SUNetID
ls /scratch/users/                # personal scratch — you will create your own folder here later
ls /yen/projects/                 # shared project storage
```

## Optional Practice

**Skip the repeated logins with SSH multiplexing**

Every time you `ssh` to the Yens you re-enter your password and approve Duo again — tedious once you're opening several sessions. **SSH multiplexing** keeps one authenticated connection open and reuses it for every later session to the same host, so you authenticate just **once**.

Set it up on your **laptop** (not the Yens) by adding this to `~/.ssh/config` — create the file if it doesn't exist:

```
Host yen yen? yen??
  HostName %h.stanford.edu

Host yen yen.stanford.edu yen? yen?? yen?.stanford.edu yen??.stanford.edu
  ControlMaster auto
  ControlPersist yes
  GSSAPIDelegateCredentials yes

Host *
  ControlPath ~/.ssh/%r@%h:%p
```

Then try it:

1. Open your first connection as usual — `ssh SUNetID@yen.stanford.edu` — and authenticate with your password and Duo. This becomes the shared "master" connection.
2. Leave it open, and in a **second** terminal run `ssh SUNetID@yen.stanford.edu` again. It connects **instantly** — no password, no Duo — because it's reusing the first connection.
