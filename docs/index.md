# Yens Onboarding 2026

A two-day, hands-on introduction to research computing and AI tools at Stanford GSB,
for incoming PhD students and faculty. Over two mornings you will build one real
pipeline end to end: get onto the Yens cluster, put your work under version control,
send filings to a language model, and scale the whole thing across the cluster with
Slurm.

## Before You Arrive

Please ensure you have the following ready for class:

1. **A [GitHub account](https://github.com/signup)**
2. **[Claude, through Stanford](https://uit.stanford.edu/service/claude)**

## The Two Days

<div class="day-layout">
  <div class="day-card">
    <h3><a href="{{ '/day1/' | relative_url }}">Day 1 — Foundations &amp; AI</a></h3>
    <p>9:00–12:00</p>
  </div>
  <div class="day-skills">SSH &middot; cluster file system &middot; Git &amp; GitHub &middot; Claude Code &middot; Python environments &middot; LLM API calls &middot; API keys &middot; Pydantic validation</div>

  <div class="day-card">
    <h3><a href="{{ '/day2/' | relative_url }}">Day 2 — The Yen-Slurm Cluster</a></h3>
    <p>9:00–12:00</p>
  </div>
  <div class="day-skills">Profiling &middot; Slurm &middot; Slurm arrays &middot; GPUs</div>
</div>

Both mornings run 9:00–12:00 and share the same shape: a short lecture at 9:00 and again
at 10:30, each opening into a long block where you work at your own pace. There are no
scheduled breaks — take your own when you reach a stopping point. The
[Reference]({{ '/reference/' | relative_url }}) section holds the material we could not
fit — local LLMs, LLM-as-a-judge, `scp`, and more.

## The Running Project

Both days build one pipeline over the same dataset: **SEC Form 3 filings**, the public
disclosures insiders file when they acquire a position in a company. They are
unstructured text, and the job is to turn them into structured records you can
analyze.

| | What you build |
|---|---|
| **Day 1** | A script that reads one filing, extracts fields with an LLM, and validates them. Then ten filings. |
| **Day 2** | The same work, profiled, submitted to Slurm, and scaled with a job array. Plus the README that makes it rerunnable. |

Your `README.md` is the deliverable that grows across both days. It is also the thing
your future self will thank you for.
