# Exploring Cluster Usage Data

Before you run your own jobs on the Yens, it helps to see how the machine actually gets used — who's running what, how busy the cores are, how much memory is in play. Digging into a real snapshot is also the easiest way to build intuition for the vocabulary you'll lean on all day: what a **process** is, what a **user** is, the difference between **RAM** in use and **virtual** memory reserved. You'll explore it with Claude — the same instinct you'll use on any messy dataset in your own research.

---

## What Is This Data?

The Yens run a monitoring script every few minutes that calls `top` in batch mode — the same tool you'd run interactively, but automated. It captures a snapshot of every process running on the node at that instant, then saves it as a CSV.

The file below is one such snapshot from yen1, taken on July 10, 2026 at 20:56. Each row is one process.

| Column | What it means |
|--------|---------------|
| `timestamp` | When the snapshot was taken |
| `host` | Which Yen node |
| `pid` | Process ID — unique number the OS assigns to each running program |
| `user` | SUNetID of the process owner |
| `pr` | Scheduling priority — lower numbers run first (`rt` means real-time priority) |
| `ni` | Nice value — a user-adjustable priority offset; negative = higher priority, positive = lower |
| `virt` | Virtual memory reserved by the process (bytes) |
| `res` | Resident memory — RAM physically in use right now (bytes) |
| `shr` | Shared memory (bytes) — memory the process shares with others, e.g. loaded libraries |
| `s` | Status: `R` = running (using CPU), `S` = sleeping (idle, holding RAM), `I` = idle kernel thread |
| `cpu_pct` | % of one CPU core in use — 100% means one full core (yen1 has 256 cores) |
| `mem_pct` | % of total node RAM in use |
| `time_plus` | Cumulative CPU time since the process started |
| `command` | Program name (`top` truncates long names to 8 characters) |
| `type` | `u` = user process, `s` = system/kernel process |

## Exercise: Explore the Usage Data

{: .important }
> **Task:** Load the yenstop snapshot, explore it with Claude, make a visualization, and write up one finding in your README.

Load the file and explore it **with Claude** — ask it about the columns, dig into what's running, and have it help you **make a visualization** of an insight you find.

```python
import pandas as pd

cols = ['timestamp','host','pid','user','pr','ni','virt','res','shr',
        's','cpu_pct','mem_pct','time_plus','command','type']

DATA = '/scratch/shared/yens-onboarding-2026/data/yenstop_2026-07-10-20-56-06.csv'

df = pd.read_csv(DATA, header=None, names=cols, on_bad_lines='skip')
df.head()
```

{: .optional }
> **Your turn — pick a thread to pull.** Some directions to start (don't feel limited to these):
> - Who is using the most CPU? The most memory? Are they the same person?
> - How many processes are actually running right now versus just sleeping?
> - What commands appear most often? What do you think they are?
> - How long have some of these processes been running? Does anything surprise you?
> - What does virtual memory look like compared to resident memory for the same process?
> - yen1 has about **1 TB of RAM**, and `mem_pct` is each process's share of that. What is the single biggest process using, in **GB**? Cross-check your answer against the `res` column — that's the actual bytes resident in RAM.

Make a plot. Ask Claude to explain something. Follow a thread that looks interesting.

{: .note }
> **Seeing your plot on the cluster.** There's no screen to pop a plot window open on, so you have two options:
>
> - **In JupyterHub** — run your code in a notebook and the plot renders inline.
> - **From a script or the terminal** — save the figure to a file, then open that file from Jupyter's file browser:
>
>     ```python
>     import matplotlib
>     matplotlib.use("Agg")          # no display needed
>     import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
>     # ... build your plot ...
>     plt.savefig("usage_plot.png", dpi=150, bbox_inches="tight")
>     ```

### Write it up

Find one thing in the data worth keeping. Add a short section to your `README.md` — a few sentences describing what you found and what it tells you about how shared research nodes actually get used.

## Optional Practice
{: .note }
> Finished early? Try any of these.

**Optional practice — Per-User Limits vs. the Whole Node**

Group the processes by `user` and compute total `cpu_pct` and `mem_pct` per person. Then compare two different ceilings:

- the **per-user limit** — the cap any single researcher gets, and
- the **whole node's capacity** — the total cores and RAM on the specific Yen node you're on.

Look both up on the [Yen user limits page](https://rcpedia.stanford.edu/_policies/user_limits/) — they vary by node, so don't assume a fixed number.

Is anyone close to their per-user limit? And how much of the *entire node* is actually in use? A node can sit far from full even while one user is maxed out — that's the per-user limit doing its job: keeping any one job from starving everyone else on a shared machine.

**Optional practice — Watch It Live (`top`)**

The CSV you've been analyzing is a **photograph** — one frozen instant, captured by a script that ran `top` once and saved the result. `top` itself is the **live view**: the same numbers, refreshing every few seconds. SSH to a Yen node and run it:

```bash
top
```

Two parts to read:
- **The header block** (top few lines) is node-wide: load averages, task counts, overall `%Cpu(s)`, and total memory used/free.
- **The table below** is one row per process — the same fields as your CSV: `PID`, `USER`, `%CPU`, `%MEM`, `TIME+`, `S` (status), `COMMAND`.

While it's running, try these keys:
- `P` — sort by CPU (the default) · `M` — sort by memory
- `u`, then type a username and press Enter — show only that person's processes
- `q` — quit

Watch for a few seconds: which processes churn near a full core, and which just sit `S` (sleeping)? Press `q` to quit when you're done.
